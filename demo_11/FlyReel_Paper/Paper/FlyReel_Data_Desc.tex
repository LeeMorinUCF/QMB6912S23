\section{Data Description}


By engaging an industry consultant to gather relevant and appropriate 
information, your firm has been able to put together data concerning 248 
different fly-fishing reels, over one-half of which are produced in the 
United States, with the remainder being produced in Asia---either in China 
or Korea.  These data are contained in the file {\tt FlyReels.csv}, which is
available in the {\tt Data} folder.
Each fly-fishing reel in the data set is a row, while the columns correspond 
to the variables whose names and definitions are the following:
