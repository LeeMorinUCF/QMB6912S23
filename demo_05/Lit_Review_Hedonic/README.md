[Hedonic Pricing](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/hedonic-pricing/).
Their motivation for studying these models is for the valuation of securities. 

[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com) has a similar review 
[here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedonicpricing.asp), 
which cites Sherwin Rosen's article as the original reference.

In another application, 
[Ecosystem Valuation](ecosystemvaluation.org/)
shows a case study of an empirical project to measure the value of
environmental amenities near homes:
