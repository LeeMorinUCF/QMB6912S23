## The Market for Lemons


The Website [Policnomics](https://policonomics.com) has 
an appropriate [summary of the paper](https://policonomics.com/the-market-for-lemons/) 
and a simple numerical example of how a market can break down. 

They also have summaries of [asymmetric information](https://policonomics.com/asymmetric-information/), 
including symptoms such as [adverse selection](https://policonomics.com/adverse-selection/)
and [moral hazard](https://policonomics.com/moral-hazard/). 


Usually my first Google hit is 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org), 
which has a thorough [description of the article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons), 
including brief descriptions of
its critical reception and implications. 


I found this article on an educational Website 
for an online book called [Introduction to Economic Analysis](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introduction-to-economic-analysis/index.html):
[Market for Lemons](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introduction-to-economic-analysis/s19-01-market-for-lemons.html)


A short YouTube video describes the situation nicely:
