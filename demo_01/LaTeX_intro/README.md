# Introduction to LaTeX

This demo provides a basic introduction to document generation with LaTeX,
which is a *markup* language for producing documents with text and graphics.
The first script ```Sample_Document_1.tex``` is the most basic ```tex``` file
that produces a one-line document.
The next script ```Sample_Document_2.tex``` includes section headings with references to each section.
The section numbers are determined automatically based on the order in which they appear.

Then we move to the sample document ```SolutionTemplate.tex``` for Problem Set 1 provided on Webcourses.
This document has a header designed for Problem Set 1 with some examples of formatting options.
The next document ```SolutionTemplate.tex``` is a modified version that includes sections
corresponding to the research papers in Problem Set 1.

You can run these in a GUI for MiKTeX, such as TeXworks to produce a pdf document from each script.
