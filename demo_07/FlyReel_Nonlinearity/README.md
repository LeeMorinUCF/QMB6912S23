## Instructions:

Run the script ```DoWork.sh```, which performs the following:

1. Run the script ```FlyReel_Nonlinearity.R```
which reads the dataset ```FlyReels.csv```
and estimates linear regression models
with nonlinear elements,
saving the results in ```.pdf``` files in the 
```Figures``` folder and tables of regression results
in ```tex``` files in the ```Tables``` folder.

1. Run the command ```pdflatex```
on the ```.tex``` script ```FlyReel_Nonlinearity.tex```
in the ```Paper``` folder.
This generates the document ```FlyReel_Nonlinearity.pdf```,
which is saved in the ```Paper``` folder.
