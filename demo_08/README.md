# Nonparametric Estimation

*Nonparametric methods* are used to fit statistical models 
with arbitrary forms of nonlinearity.
We will discuss two forms: kernel smoothing and tree methods. 
Tree methods are often used to determine 
which variables should be in the model:
methods for *dimension reduction*.  
In contrast, kernel smoothing methods are often used 
with a small set of candidate variables
to fine-tune the way the variables fit in the model:
a method for choosing the *functional form* of a regression model. 
Strictly speaking, this produces 
a type of *semiparametric* model: 
it has a linear specification that includes
a variable that is a nonparametric fit of a variable, 
thus it is part parametric and part nonparametric.
