%% Regression model description:



The regression model predicts housing prices as follows 
(all figures in millions).
For every one dollar increase in average income, housing prices are expected 
to rise by 4.303. 
If the home is located in California, housing prices are expected 
to be 0.240 higher. 
If there was an earthquake in the zip code, housing prices are expected 
to be -0.562 lower. 
Overall, this model provides a fairly good description with an $R^2$ of 0.677.
