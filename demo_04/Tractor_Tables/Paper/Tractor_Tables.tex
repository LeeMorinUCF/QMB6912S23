\section{Data Description}

This analysis follows the script \texttt{Tractor\_Reg\_Model.R} to produce a more accurate model for used tractor prices with the data from \texttt{TRACTOR7.csv} in the \texttt{Data} folder. 
The dataset includes the following variables.
\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{tabular}{l l l}

$saleprice_i$ & = & the price paid for tractor $i$ in dollars \\
% 
$horsepower_i$ & = & the horsepower of tractor $i$ \\
$age_i$ & = & the number of years since tractor $i$ was manufactured  \\
$enghours_i$ & = & the number of hours of use recorded for tractor $i$  \\
$diesel_i$ & = & an indicator of whether tractor $i$ runs on diesel fuel \\ %, $0$ otherwise \\
$fwd_i$ & = & an indicator of whether tractor $i$ has four-wheel drive \\ %, $0$ otherwise \\
$manual_i$ & = & an indicator of whether tractor $i$ has a manual transmission \\ %, $0$ otherwise \\
$johndeere_i$ & = & an indicator of whether tractor $i$ is manufactured by John Deere \\ %, $0$ otherwise \\
$cab_i$ & = & an indicator of whether tractor $i$ has an enclosed cab \\ %, $0$ otherwise \\
% 
$spring_i$ & = & an indicator of whether tractor $i$ was sold in April or May \\ %, $0$ otherwise \\
$summer_i$ & = & an indicator of whether tractor $i$ was sold between June and September \\ %, $0$ otherwise \\
$winter_i$ & = & an indicator of whether tractor $i$ was sold between December and March \\ %, $0$ otherwise \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\bigskip
\noindent
I have downloaded the file {\tt TRACTOR7.csv}, 
loaded the data described above into 
\textsf{R}, 
calculated the summary statistics for these data, 
and finally, presented 
these statistics in \LaTeX\ tables.
These operations are all performed by the script 
{\tt Tractor\_Tables.R} in the {\tt Code} folder. 
The script uses an \textsf{R} package called {\tt xtable} 
to automate the
production of the tables from a data frames in \textsf{R}.)

\medskip
\noindent
I analyze the data in subsets, according to the makes of tractors, 
calculating the summary statistics for each subset and present these 
statistics in the \LaTeX\ tables that follow.

\section{Summary by Country of Manufacture}

Table \ref{tab:summ_by_country} lists summary statistics for numeric variables
in separate columns for subsamples defined by the country of manufacture.

\section{Country of Manufacture by Brand of Fly Reel}

Table \ref{tab:country_by_brand} lists the frequencies of observations of 
each brand of fly reel by country of manufacture.

\section{Reel Design by Brand of Fly Reel}

Table \ref{tab:design_by_brand} lists the frequencies of observations of 
each brand of fly reel across two categorical variables:
whether the reel is sealed
and whether the reel is machined versus cast.
