## Characteristic Theory for Product Demand


An online library called [Social Science Libre Texts](https://socialsci.libretexts.org)
has an interactive Webpage called 
[Lancasterâ€™s (1966) Characteristics Model](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Economics/Book%3A_An_Interactive_Text_for_Food_and_Agricultural_Marketing_(Thomsen)/05%3A_Consumer_Theory_and_Models/5.03%3A_Section_3-). 
This is a good review because it focuses on the economic foundation of the idea:
it shows that Lancaster aimed to explicitly model 
the relationship between prices and characteristics
from the choices of consumers. 
This page also refers to Rosen's hedonic pricing models as an extension. 


Incidentally, I found an article that claims to produce 
["a formal refutation of  Lancaster's theory"](http://bowbrick.org.uk/Publications/Refuting%20Lancaster's%20Characteristics%20Theory.pdf) 
of pricing based on characteristics. 
However, I feel that the author misses the point...of both the theory itself
and of economics in general. 
It is worth talking about for context
when it comes to using the scientific method in the social sciences.
