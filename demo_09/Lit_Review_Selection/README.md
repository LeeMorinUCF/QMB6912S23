# Literature Review


## Tobit Models

Here we will review some material to supplement the survey article on Tobit models by T. Amemiya (1984). 

Let's cut straight to
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org), 
which has a thorough [description of the models referred to as Tobit models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobit_model). 

This review is worth going into detail in order to sort through the terminology and notation. 



## Sample Selection

Heckman (1979) considers the issue of sample selection as a form of specification error. 


Specification error is defined as a situation where one or more key feature, variable or assumption of a statistical model is not correct. Specification is the process of developing the statistical model in a regression analysis.

A Website called The Analysis Factor has a post
[What Is Specification Error in Statistical Models?](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/specification-error-in-statistical-models/) that describes the typical scenarios. 

Selection bias is a mismeasurement of coefficients that results from
a sample that has been selected as a result of characteristics of the observations. 
See the review here:
[Selection Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias). 

This brief review is meant to guide a discussion of the relevant terminology relating to sample selection and methods for dealing with it.
